    "Likelihood refers to the chances of some calculated parameters producing some known data. In ML, the parameters are updated to fit a static dataset. \r\n",

    "Cost function that is used as loss for machine learning classification models (the lower the better). We use NEGATIVE because most ML frameworks only have minimization optimization functionality.\r\n",

    "We take $\\ln$ because it's cleaner to use when have high or low numbers.\r\n",
