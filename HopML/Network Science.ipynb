    "\r\n",
    "2. There exists no central point\r\n",

    "\r\n",

    "\r\n",

    "In simple systems, the properties of the whole can be understood or predicted from the addition or aggregation of its components. If you have knowledge of the microscopic properties of your system, you can predict macroscopic properties of the system.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "In complex systems, knowing the knowledge of the components will not be enough to know what happens at the end. Here, the whole is more than the sum of its parts. These systems change their states dynamically and its likely hard to expect what will happen.\r\n",
