    "## Components of complex systems\n",
    "\n",
    "Complex systems are ones which \n",
    "\n",
    "1. have many interactions\n",
    "\n",
    "2. There exists no central point\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interactions\n",
    "\n",
    "Interacting occur between nodes and with their environment\n",
    "\n",
    "### Emergence\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes we see something happen that we dont expect but its the result of the interaction of all of us.\n",
    "\n",
    "In simple systems, the properties of the whole can be understood or predicted from the addition or aggregation of its components. If you have knowledge of the microscopic properties of your system, you can predict macroscopic properties of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "In complex systems, knowing the knowledge of the components will not be enough to know what happens at the end. Here, the whole is more than the sum of its parts. These systems change their states dynamically and its likely hard to expect what will happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Self-organization\n",
    "\n",
    "Complex systems may self-organize to produce non-trivial patterns spontaneously without a blueprint. For example, \n",
    "\n",
    "* local tree growth with random forest fires caused by lightning yield complex spatio-temporal patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adaption\n",
    "\n",
    "Complex systems may adapt and evolve. Complex systems are often active and responding to the environment.  For example, \n",
    "\n",
    "* immune system continuously learning about pathogens\n",
    "\n",
    "* evolution theory\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interdisciplinary\n",
    "\n",
    "Complex systems appear in all scientific and professional domains.\n",
    "\n",
    "Universality means that many systems in different domains display phenomena with common underlying features that can be described using the same scientific models. This is a common idea in **transfer learning**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Complex science involves many variables and configurations, needs advanced mathematical and computational modeling, analysis and simulations, and needs to use computers to check ifa  set of hypothetical rules could lead to a behavior observed in nature. For example,\n",
    "\n",
    "* Agent-based modeling for the flocking of birds\n",

    "* System Theory: Mother of complexity theory, a framework which can be investigated and/or develops any group of objects that work together to produce some result\n",
    "\n",
    "* Chaos Theory: Concerns deterministic systems whose behavior can, in principle, be predicted. They are highly sensitive to initial conditions (butterfly effect). Chaotic systems are predictable for a while and then 'appear' to become random.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Adaptive System Theory: Organization of things without any central control. This deals with action and behavior of others and operate on simple rules. Examples: evolutionary adaption in biology, robotics\n",
    "\n",
    "* Network Theory: study of graphs as a representation of relations between discrete objects. Studies real-world data. Examples: social networks, gene interactions, pandemics, transporation networks, citation networks\n"
