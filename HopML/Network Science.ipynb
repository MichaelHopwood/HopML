    "\r\n",
    "Complex systems are ones which \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "1. have many interactions\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "2. There exists no central point\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### Interactions\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Interacting occur between nodes and with their environment\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### Emergence\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Sometimes we see something happen that we dont expect but its the result of the interaction of all of us.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "In simple systems, the properties of the whole can be understood or predicted from the addition or aggregation of its components. If you have knowledge of the microscopic properties of your system, you can predict macroscopic properties of the system.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "In complex systems, knowing the knowledge of the components will not be enough to know what happens at the end. Here, the whole is more than the sum of its parts. These systems change their states dynamically and its likely hard to expect what will happen.\r\n",

    "\r\n",

    "### Methods\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Complex science involves many variables and configurations, needs advanced mathematical and computational modeling, analysis and simulations, and needs to use computers to check ifa  set of hypothetical rules could lead to a behavior observed in nature. For example,\r\n",

    "* Chaos Theory: Concerns deterministic systems whose behavior can, in principle, be predicted. They are highly sensitive to initial conditions (butterfly effect). Chaotic systems are predictable for a while and then 'appear' to become random.\r\n",

    "* Adaptive System Theory: Organization of things without any central control. This deals with action and behavior of others and operate on simple rules. Examples: evolutionary adaption in biology, robotics\r\n",
