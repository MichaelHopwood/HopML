    "a field of amplitude modulated signals\n",

    "p sporadically throughout data science\n",
    "but i'm going to tell you that kernel\n",

    "there is actually an underlying\n",

    "which that whole theorem actually works\n",
    "on and this hiller space\n",
    "is called the paley wiener space so\n",
    "let's talk about the general definition\n",
    "of what a kernel space is so reproducing\n",
    "kernel helper space\n",
    "is a hilbert space of functions that map\n",
    "say\n",
    "a set x could be a subset of rn could be\n",
    "complex plane or many other things and\n",
    "so what we're going to do is we're going\n",
    "to take a look at a hilbert space from\n",
    "the set x to\n",
    "say the reals or the complex numbers and\n",
    "so the core thing that makes a\n",
    "reproducing kernel helper space a\n",
    "reproducing kernel helper space\n",
    "is that we have function evaluation\n",
    "being\n",
    "a bounded functional so what this means\n",
    "is that if i take\n",
    "a function f and i map it to f of x for\n",
    "some fixed x\n",
    "then that should be a bounded linear\n",
    "functional\n",
    "on the hilbert space there's a thing\n",
    "called the breeze theorem that basically\n",
    "says that whenever you have a bounded\n",
    "linear functional\n",
    "there is going to be a unique element\n",
    "inside your hilbert space\n",
    "that reproduces that functional through\n",
    "the inner product\n",
    "and in particular we're reproducing the\n",
    "function evaluation that's where they\n",
    "get their name\n",
    "as reproducing kernels so we'll have a\n",
    "func so for the evaluation functional\n",
    "at a point x we have the reproducing\n",
    "kernel centered at x\n",
    "inside of our hilbert space and you can\n",
    "make something called the kernel\n",
    "function which is a positive definite\n",
    "kernel\n",
    "which has its own sort of definition and\n",
    "we make this by saying that k\n",
    "x y for two points x and y inside of x\n",
    "we define it as being the inner product\n",
    "with k y\n",
    "with kx in our hilbert space now the\n",
    "order does matter there if you're\n",
    "working with a complex valued function\n",
    "because then the inner product itself is\n",
    "going to end up being complex valued and\n",
    "so is the kernel if we're working over a\n",
    "space\n",
    "just maps into the reals then we don't\n",
    "have to worry about that it's so much\n",
    "you can have\n",
    "kx then ky but just not a good habit you\n",
    "should always put ky first\n",
    "and so this k x y is called the kernel\n",
    "function for the hilbert space\n",
    "and there's something called aaronshine\n",
    "moore theorem that says anytime you have\n",
    "a kernel function that is a positive\n",
    "definite kernel\n",
    "there exists a unique hilbert space\n",
    "corresponding to that\n",
    "what does it mean to be a positive\n",
    "definite kernel well it means that if\n",
    "you take a finite collection of points\n",
    "in your set x and you make this gram\n",
    "matrix that we did with all of our\n",
    "covariances\n",
    "then that should be positive\n",
    "semi-definite as long as that's positive\n",
    "semi-definite there is going to be a\n",
    "hilbert space that corresponds to this\n",
    "positive definite kernel and that's our\n",
    "representative space\n",
    "okay so i said kernel functions\n",
    "everywhere this seems kind of\n",
    "abstract and i mean gaussian rbf kernels\n",
    "were really pushed forward by vapnik\n",
    "back in the early 1990s in shulkov\n",
    "and that comes up in say support vector\n",
    "machines\n",
    "and then we have all these like rbf\n",
    "kernels and all those things and that\n",
    "all seems rather\n",
    "modern and so to a typical engineer\n",
    "who's never heard of\n",
    "re-music kernels all through their\n",
    "undergrad or even their grad school\n",
    "and they go on and they try to do some\n",
    "research in this field and they bump\n",
    "into these things that seem to have come\n",
    "from these things like gaussian\n",
    "processes it seems very very abstract\n",
    "and maybe very niche as far as their\n",
    "applications\n",
    "but the truth is reproducing kernels\n",
    "have been in the literature and used\n",
    "throughout\n",
    "mathematics and engineering for the past\n",
    "century\n",
    "i think they got their inception as a\n",
    "proper study of themselves\n",
    "well before aaronshine came along and\n",
    "codified everything in his\n",
    "1950 paper and even something that\n",
    "mathematicians and engineers study\n",
    "through undergraduate and graduate\n",
    "school are greens functions\n",
    "and these are kernels in a certain sense\n",
    "kernel functions take the place\n",
    "of the delta function where the delta\n",
    "function\n",
    "is really represents the functional of\n",
    "function evaluation\n",
    "in things like the short space where we\n",
    "had tempered distributions now since\n",
    "kernel functions have to be inside the\n",
    "hilbert space that means that they have\n",
    "to be proper functions themselves\n",
    "and so standing in for these delta\n",
    "functions are these kernel functions\n",
    "and in particular we have to be working\n",
    "over function spaces\n",
    "i said i would name the individual\n",
    "responsible for this murder\n",
    "of that is what i'm doing now what is\n",
    "this reason why i reject all those\n",
    "papers\n",
    "that i put in the secret envelope here\n",
    "well actually i didn't write anything\n",
    "inside the envelope i just\n",
    "reject on it but the truth is most\n",
    "engineers think that\n",
    "l2 is a function space\n",
    "and it is not so l2 on the surface looks\n",
    "like it might be a function space people\n",
    "write the norm of\n",
    "l2 as being the integral from say\n",
    "negative infinity to infinity\n",
    "or 0 to 1 of the absolute value of f of\n",
    "x\n",
    "squared dx now while that is a function\n",
    "that we're putting inside of that\n",
    "integral\n",
    "that is actually a representative of an\n",
    "equivalence class\n",
    "which is the actual elements inside of\n",
    "our l2 space l2 consists\n",
    "of equivalence classes of functions and\n",
    "what this means is that we\n",
    "have some special way of defining\n",
    "equality of elements inside of\n",
    "l2 so if we take an equivalence class\n",
    "out of l2 one of the members of l2\n",
    "and we take two elements out of that\n",
    "equivalence class\n",
    "those are going to be two different\n",
    "functions that could actually defer\n",
    "on a set of measure zero so if we have\n",
    "any\n",
    "say finite point set that's a big\n",
    "measure zero set\n",
    "and the difference between these two\n",
    "functions are going to be zero\n",
    "except possibly on those measure zero\n",
    "sets\n",
    "and when it comes to sampling problems\n",
    "if you take a finite number of elements\n",
    "and you try to look at look to l2 to\n",
    "sort of interpolate\n",
    "those elements or treat those as samples\n",
    "of one of your elements in l2\n",
    "it doesn't mean anything because any\n",
    "sample set is measure zero\n",
    "and elements in l2 can do anything they\n",
    "want around these\n",
    "sampled points and so in that sense\n",
    "function evaluation\n",
    "is meaningless for l2 and that means it\n",
    "can't be a reproduce in kernel helper\n",
    "space but\n",
    "then you might argue with me well what\n",
    "is all the sampling theory\n",
    "i mean we have the nyquist theorem and\n",
    "that seems to be working over l2\n",
    "functions\n",
    "and i'm going to tell you right now the\n",
    "nyquist theorem\n",
    "has nothing to do with l2 okay it has\n",
    "something to do with l2 but the\n",
    "functions itself that you're sampling\n",
    "are not from just l2 they're actually\n",
    "from what we call the paley wiener space\n",
    "[Music]\n",
    "okay so there are a few things we need\n",
    "to know about the fourier transform\n",
    "and functions that satisfy the l2 norm\n",
    "so\n",
    "the fundamental thing we're going to be\n",
    "talking about here is that\n",
    "the fourier transform of an l2 function\n",
    "gives you another function\n",
    "that satisfies the l2 norm and so\n",
    "if you have a function whose l2 norm is\n",
    "finite\n",
    "then the fourier transform of that has\n",
    "an l2 norm that is also finite\n",
    "and that's a very important step to\n",
    "start with the paley weiner theorem says\n",
    "that if you start with a function that\n",
    "is non-zero\n",
    "only on a compact subset of frequency\n",
    "domain and you take the inverse fourier\n",
    "transform\n",
    "then the result is going to be a\n",
    "function that\n",
    "is entire and this is a very easy thing\n",
    "to show and it basically uses the\n",
    "dominated convergence theorem to move\n",
    "differentiation in through the integral\n",
    "and then you can show that it satisfies\n",
    "kosher riemann equations\n",
    "and you show that it works for every\n",
    "single z that you choose in a complex\n",
    "plane\n",
    "again you might be railing against me\n",
    "and saying well this doesn't sound like\n",
    "we're talking about sampling theorem in\n",
    "the complex plane this isn't the real\n",
    "line\n",
    "at any complex entire function we can\n",
    "restrict to just the complex plane\n",
    "and we can talk about only the real\n",
    "values and so we can turn this into\n",
    "statements about\n",
    "real entire functions things that are\n",
    "really common to you like sines and\n",
    "cosines and exponential functions\n",
    "what i'm going to do then is i'm going\n",
    "to restrict our focus to just being a\n",
    "single interval\n",
    "say negative a to a inside of our\n",
    "frequency domain\n",
    "and we're going to take a look at all\n",
    "functions that are non-zero\n",
    "only inside of that region and so if i\n",
    "take the fourier transform from negative\n",
    "infinity to infinity\n",
    "well really we can chop off those two\n",
    "tails and just look at this integral\n",
    "from negative 8a\n",
    "and then we're looking for the inverse\n",
    "fourier transform of this\n",
    "and so we're basically going to have say\n",
    "f hat of omega times\n",
    "e to the i x times omega and this is\n",
    "going to give us\n",
    "what we'll call f x or you can change x\n",
    "for z if you prefer\n",
    "and this is going to be our entire\n",
    "function\n",
    "so we want to make a reproducing kernel\n",
    "helper space\n",
    "what we're going to do is we're going to\n",
    "take these\n",
    "entire functions that satisfy the l2\n",
    "norm\n",
    "and what we're going to do is we're\n",
    "going to take their fourier transform\n",
    "which we know is compactly supported\n",
    "in a certain region of the frequency\n",
    "domain negative a to a now what this\n",
    "gives us is a way to define the inner\n",
    "product we're not going to define the\n",
    "inner products on the functions\n",
    "themselves\n",
    "we're going to define the inner product\n",
    "on their fourier transforms\n",
    "so we'll say that the inner product\n",
    "between two of these functions out of\n",
    "our paleo wiener space\n",
    "is say f and g this inner product\n",
    "is defined as being the\n",
    "l2 inner product between f hat and g\n",
    "hat on negative 8 a so this gives us a\n",
    "well-defined inner product and it gives\n",
    "us a well-defined hilbert space\n",
    "now here's where the cool thing is we\n",
    "can make the reproducing kernel\n",
    "for the paleo inner space really easy\n",
    "just using the theory of fourier\n",
    "transforms\n",
    "so remember this function that we are\n",
    "trying to use to make the reproducing\n",
    "kernel hover space\n",
    "is going to be inside of our paleowiener\n",
    "space itself so that means it has to\n",
    "live within this\n",
    "negative a to a region inside of our\n",
    "frequency domain but\n",
    "so does every other function inside that\n",
    "space we know that we can recover\n",
    "function evaluation using the inverse\n",
    "fourier transform here\n",
    "okay so let's take a function f of x\n",
    "and we want to evaluate it at a point y\n",
    "in our paleo inner space the paleo inner\n",
    "space has well-defined function\n",
    "evaluation at the very least because of\n",
    "the space of entire functions\n",
    "so i want to know what is function\n",
    "evaluation at the point\n",
    "y what does that look like from the\n",
    "kernel space perspective so we're trying\n",
    "to find a kernel function centered at y\n",
    "so so the route that we're going to do\n",
    "is we're going to figure out what's\n",
    "fourier transform is and that's because\n",
    "the inner product for paleo weiner\n",
    "functions happens in the frequency\n",
    "domain so what i'm going to do is i'm\n",
    "going to take a look at the only thing\n",
    "that can really work\n",
    "here and that is the inverse fourier\n",
    "transform so we're trying to figure out\n",
    "what is f of y and well that is going to\n",
    "be the integral from negative infinity\n",
    "to infinity of\n",
    "of f hat of omega times e\n",
    "to the i y times omega d y but since we\n",
    "know that\n",
    "f hat of omega is compactly supported we\n",
    "can change this whole integral down to\n",
    "negative eight a\n",
    "and that looks a lot like our inner\n",
    "product so how do we dress this up to be\n",
    "exactly our inner product which would\n",
    "tell us what the fourier transform is\n",
    "of our reproducing kernel so we have f\n",
    "had a w\n",
    "or f hat of omega and we know that\n",
    "that's half of our enterprise so\n",
    "everything else has to correspond to\n",
    "our reproduce and kernel so what we're\n",
    "going to do is we need to put that under\n",
    "a bar because we know that the other\n",
    "half of the inner product has to be\n",
    "conjugated\n",
    "so then we make this adjustment and so\n",
    "what we get is we flip the sign in\n",
    "the exponential we put a bar on top and\n",
    "so we get e to the minus\n",
    "i y omega bar but what you're missing\n",
    "there then\n",
    "is that heat and minus i y omega\n",
    "is not compactly supported so it can't\n",
    "be inside of our paleo wiener space\n",
    "so how do we fix this well we're going\n",
    "to make a change here that\n",
    "isn't going to change anything else\n",
    "about our inner product and that is\n",
    "we're going to multiply\n",
    "by the characteristic function of\n",
    "negative a to a and what happens when we\n",
    "do that\n",
    "is we end up getting the fourier\n",
    "transform of whatever our refusing\n",
    "kernel is\n",
    "and we know this is fine because i mean\n",
    "multiplying by this characteristic\n",
    "function isn't going to change anything\n",
    "because the the compact the\n",
    "supportedness\n",
    "of our fourier transform of f already\n",
    "restricted our interval to negative a to\n",
    "a\n",
    "so nothing bad happens just by\n",
    "multiplying by this characteristic\n",
    "function which is just one\n",
    "inside of negative 8 a so then we have\n",
    "the fourier transform of our reproducing\n",
    "kernel\n",
    "centered at y and so and that this is a\n",
    "function of omega for a fixed y\n",
    "and we want to figure out what this\n",
    "function is as a function of x and so\n",
    "we're going to use the inverse fourier\n",
    "transform on this\n",
    "evaluate that on x and what this ends up\n",
    "giving you\n",
    "is the sync function and it's going to\n",
    "be twice the same function it's like 2\n",
    "times sine of a times x minus y\n",
    "bar divided by a times x minus y bar\n",
    "there might be two pi\n",
    "factors floating around in there and\n",
    "i'll fix that in the edits and you'll\n",
    "see those\n",
    "on the screen here but that shows us\n",
    "that this paleo wiener space\n",
    "is a reproducing kernel over space now\n",
    "how do we get the nyquist theorem out of\n",
    "this\n",
    "and how do we do sampling out of this\n",
    "and that is the next step\n",
    "so this next bit is always a little\n",
    "tricky for me i i do most of these\n",
    "videos sort of off the cuff i just sit\n",
    "in front of the camera and start\n",
    "jabbering\n",
    "and i have a vague idea of what i want\n",
    "to say and then i say about a million\n",
    "things i edit down to about 20 minutes\n",
    "30 minutes and so\n",
    "so some of my constants might be off\n",
    "some of my scalings might be off and\n",
    "i'll\n",
    "adjust it when i actually write all the\n",
    "equations but\n",
    "the fundamental idea of the nyquist\n",
    "theorem and how it comes into\n",
    "the sampling theory and the paleo wiener\n",
    "space\n",
    "is that when you take a look at the\n",
    "these band limited functions\n",
    "which is what the paley's wiener space\n",
    "is just we fixed\n",
    "this interval negative eight a when you\n",
    "fix these these band limited functions\n",
    "you take a look at their inner product\n",
    "uh which is coming from the\n",
    "l2 inner product on fourier transforms\n",
    "the collection of functions e to the i n\n",
    "omega are orthogonal in\n",
    "my say to a you know times some sort of\n",
    "frequency that depends on a\n",
    "and what's really cool is that we\n",
    "already know that these functions\n",
    "themselves\n",
    "correspond to our reproducing kernels\n",
    "and so\n",
    "if we just multiply by the\n",
    "characteristic function\n",
    "of negative a to a then we have a\n",
    "countable number of kernels\n",
    "and we know that they must span the\n",
    "space because the norm on the paleo\n",
    "wiener space\n",
    "comes from this l2 space and these\n",
    "exponential functions\n",
    "are a complete basis on this l2 space so\n",
    "tada we have sampling theory if you take\n",
    "a function and you expand it in terms of\n",
    "this orthonormal basis\n",
    "then you get kernel functions and it's a\n",
    "very unique\n",
    "set of kernel functions that are\n",
    "actually pairwise orthogonal\n",
    "it's a book what we have is a collection\n",
    "of shifted sync functions\n",
    "and they're all pairwise orthogonal\n",
    "according to this l2 inner product that\n",
    "we came up with\n",
