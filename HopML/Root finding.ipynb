    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In statistical applications, point estimation problems often boil down to maximize a function according to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* maximize likelihood\n",
    "\n",
    "* least squares\n",
    "\n",
    "* maximum of a posterior distribution (i.e. bayesian)\n",
    "\n",
    "When the function to be optimized is \"smooth\", we can reformulate optimization into a root finding problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Trouble:** these problems often have no analytical solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "## General setup\n",
    "\n",
    "We will discuss 2 kinds of problems\n",
    "\n",
    "* Root finding: solve $f(x) = 0$ for $x \\in \\mathbf{R}^d$, $d \\geq 1$\n",
    "\n",
    "* Optimization: maximize $g(x)$ for $x \\in \\mathbf{R}^d$, $d \\geq 1$\n",
    "\n",
    "We will address univariate and multivariate problems cases separately. We will look at methods that construct a sequence $\\{ x_t : t \\geq 0}$ designed to converge (as $t \\xrightarrow{} \\infty$) to the solution, denoted by $x^\\star$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Theoretical considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "* Under what conditions on $f$ (or $g$) and initial guess $x_0$ can we prove that $x_t \\xrightarrow{} x^\\star$?\n",
    "\n",
    "* If $x_t \\xrightarrow{} x^\\star$, then how fast, i.e. what is its convergence order?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical consideration\n",
    "\n",
    "* How to write and implement the algorithm?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Can't run the algorithm till $t = \\infty$, so how to stop?"
