    "Data values that are modeled on being R.V. from any given distribution can be converted to a R.V. having uniform distribution. Let $X \\sim F_X(x)$ define a transformation where $Y = F_X(X) \\in [0,1]$. So, $X = F_X^{-1}(y)$, then $Y$ is uniform over $[0,1]$, i.e. $Y \\sim Unif(0,1)$.\r\n",

    "Here, we start from $Unif(0,1)$ and going to $Y = F_X(x)$. This is helpful because it's easy to get a $Unif(0,1)$. From here, you can get a more complicated solution.\r\n",

    "Suppose we want to simulate $X$ whose distribution has a given CDF, $F$. If $F$ is continuous and strictly increasing, then $F^{-1}$ exists. Now, sampling $U \\sim Unif(0,1)$ and setting $X = F^{-1}(u)$ does the job. This means that if $X$ has CDF $F$, then $F^{-1}(u)$ will have CDF $F$, so if you are able to calculate $F^{-1}$, and can gather uniform, then you can generate a sample from $F$.\r\n"
