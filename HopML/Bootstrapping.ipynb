    "$$\\hat{P}(A) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n I_A(x_i)$$\n",

    "$\\hat{P}$ is called the empirical distribution of the sample $X$.  $\\hat{P}$ can be thought as the distribution which puts mass $\\frac{1}{n}$ on each observation $X_i$. It can be shown that $\\hat{P}$ is a nonparametric likelihood estimator of $P$. This justifies estimating $P$ by $\\hat{P}$ if no other information about $P$ is available.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Theorem:** Let $A \\leq \\mathbf{R}$ (s.t. $P(A)$ is defined, i.e. $A$ belongs to the Borel $\\sigma$-algebra), then $\\hat{P}(A) \\xrightarrow{} P(A)$ as $n \\xrightarrow{} \\infty$. This result can proved using the Law of Large Numbers. \n",

In other words, the distribution $P(A)$ can be approximated by $\\hat{P}(A)$ equally well. for all $A \\in I$ where $I$ is the set of all intervals of $\\mathbf{R}$. This is the empirical distribution. \n",

    "## Sampling from the empirical distribution $\\hat{F}_n$\n",
    "\n",
    "To recap, we have a distribution $F$ which we do not know. So, we can use the estimator $\\hat{F}_n$, and we know that this estimator is a consistent estimator of $F$. So, how do we get a sample from $\\hat{F}_n$?\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we want to draw an iid sample $\\vec{X}^\\star = (X_1^\\star, ..., X_n^\\star)^T$ from $\\hat{F}_n$. When sampling from $\\hat{F}_n$, the $i$th observation $X_i$ in the original sample is selected with probability $\\frac{1}{n}$. If we use this idea, we can define a two-step procedure to do our sampling.\n",

    "Step 2: Set $X_j^\\star = X_{ij}$ and $\\vec{X}^\\star = (X_{i_1}^\\star, ..., X_{i_n}^\\star)^T$\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's say $\\vec{X} = (3,2,7,8,10,25)^T$ is a sample coming from a distribution that we do not know. Now, we want a sample from the empirical distribution $\\hat{F}_n$ of $X$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1: Draw $i_1, i_2, i_3, i_4, i_5, i_6$ from the uniform $\\{ 1,2,3,4,5,6 \\}$. Assume that $i_1 = 6,  i_2=3, i_3 = 1, i_4 = 2, i_5=1, i_6 = 3$ comes from the first drawing of the uniform, for instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 2: We assign $X_j^\\star = X_{ij}$. So, in our first sample $\\vec{X}_1^\\star = (x_{i_1}, x_{i_2}, x_{i_3}, x_{i_4}, x_{i_5}, x_{i_6}) = (X_6, X_3, X_1, X_2, X_1, X_3) = (25, 7, 3, 2, 3, 7)$\n",

    "Parametric bootstrap is a variation of the standard (non-parametric) bootstrap discussed previously. Suppose that we knwo that the distribution $F$ belongs to a parametric family of distribution $F_\\lambda$ with densities $p(x|\\lambda)$. If $\\hat{\\lambda}$ is an estimate of the true parameter $\\lambda$, an obvious estimate of $F$ is the distribution $F = F_{\\hat{\\lambda}}$ with density $p(x|\\hat{\\lambda})$. In this case, we can still use the bootstrapping method to obtain an estimate of the sampling distribution of $\\hat{\\theta}$ (or any function of $\\hat{\\theta}$: $p(\\hat{\\theta})$). The parametric bootstrap replaces sampling iid from $\\hat{F}_n$ (empirical distribution) with sampling iid from $F_{\\hat{\\theta}}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1: Draw $B$ independent bootstrap samples $\\vec{X}^{\\star (1)}, ..., \\vec{X}^{\\star (B)}$ from $F_{\\hat{\\lambda}}$\n",

    "Step 2: Evaluate bootstrap replications $\\hat{\\theta}^{\\star (b)} = s(\\vec{X}^{\\star (b)}), b = 1, ..., B$\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 3: Estimate the sampling distribution of $\\hat{\\theta}$ by the empirical distribution of the bootstrap replications $\\hat{\\theta}^{\\star (1)}, ..., \\hat{\\theta}^{\\star (B)}$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is potentially more complicated than nonparametric because sampling from $F_{\\hat{\\lambda}}$ might be more difficult than sampling from $\\hat{F}_n$\n",
    "\n",
    "Question: Is $\\hat{F}_n$ or $F_{\\hat{\\lambda}}$ better? Why?\n",
    "\n",

    "**Example:** Assume a normal population $N(\\mu, \\sigma^2)$ and $H_0: \\mu = 2$ vs. $H_1: \\mu \\neq 2$. \n",
    "\n",
    "If $\\sigma^2$ is unknown, we can use a $t$-statistic (but here, we try something else). \n",
    "\n",
    "We can also use the likelihood ratio statistic $\\Lambda$. Get the sampling distribution of $\\Lambda$ when $H_0$ is true. If $H_0$ is true, $\\mu=2$ and we have now $N(2, \\sigma^2)$\n",

    "As a note, $\\lambda = \\mu$ and $\\hat{\\theta} = \\Lambda$, according to the algorithm presented above\n",
    "\n",
    "Want to use Monte Carlo simulation to get the sampling distribution of $\\Lambda$ when $\\mu = 2$. However, monte carlo hypothesis testing will not work here since we do not know $\\sigma^2$. So, an alternative method is to use **parameteric bootstrap**. Use $s^2$ from the initial sample as an estimate of $\\sigma^2$. Sample from $N(2, s^2)$, then compute $\\lambda$ and sampling distribution $\\hat{\\Lambda}^{\\star (1)}, ..., \\hat{\\Lambda}^{\\star (B)}$.\n"

    "## Remarks\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The bootstrap is nonparametric but it does require some assumptions. You can't always assume it is always valid.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The bootstrap is an asymptotic method. It is very accurate when $n \\xrightarrow{} \\infty$ (because each bootstrap samples use all data)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. There is related method called \"Jacknife\". However, the bootstrap is valid under weaker conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. There are many cases where the bootstrap is not formally justified. This is especially true with discrete structures like trees and graphs. It is an informal way to get some intuition on the variability of the procedure. But, keep in mind that the formal guarantees may not apply in these cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. There is a method related to the bootstrap called subsampling. In this case, we draw samples of size $m < n$ without replacement (because without replacement, it is not the same as bootstrap). Subsampling produces valid CI under weaker conditions than the bootstrap. "
