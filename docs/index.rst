Hello, I am a PhD student at the University of Central Florida studying data science. I have worked on many data science and data analytics projects, all of which are summarized in my `CV <https://github.com/MichaelHopwood/HopML/blob/main/docs/_static/MICHAEL_HOPWOOD_CV.PDF>`_.

Summarized results of select journal papers, conference proceedings, hackathons, and personal projects are located in `projects <projects.rst>`_.
