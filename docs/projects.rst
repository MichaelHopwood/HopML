`An assessment of the value of principal component analysis for photovoltaic IV trace classification of physically-induced failures <https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9300601>`_
################

Utilizing PCA on Photovoltaic current-voltage (IV) curves improves the performance of a failure classification task. Observing the performance of a random forest classifier on point-wise classification shows better results where the IV curve profile more often contains failure trends.
